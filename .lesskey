# go to next/prev section heading
> forw-search \^[A-Z]\rn
< forw-search \^[A-Z]\rN

# reset filters
r filter \r

# go into outline mode - list only section headings
# From here you can, force scroll up and down with J/K
# as with the options trick below, you can switch between outline view and normal view seamlessly
o filter \^[A-Z]\r

# search in options
# this only displays all lines that start with '-', this is (more often than not) all the flags
# now use the normal search command, it's easier as the fov is reduced to the relevant lines
# the kicker is that once you find the option you were looking for, reset filter and voila:
# you are at the right location in the full view
# Don't like what you see in the full view, hit c to go back to the options view and voila:
# at the right location
c filter \^\ *-\r
# need a generalized version of this for all sorts of commands/args

# aliases for J/K command; useful with the outline mode
